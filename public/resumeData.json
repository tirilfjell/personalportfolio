In her role as STR, Tiril conducted trainings in stores and at events, made sure the stores were representative of Bose's brand, and followed up locally when needed. Tiril is positive, always willing to help and a doer. She has great knowledge about the products, the brand and how to approach store staff.   I can recommend Tiril for any work related to sales, store responsibility, trainings and working in teams.",
